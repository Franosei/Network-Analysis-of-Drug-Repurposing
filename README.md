# Network Analysis of Drug Repurposing Across Therapeutic Areas

This project leverages clinical trial data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) to identify potential drug repurposing opportunities across therapeutic areas using **network science techniques**. The analysis focuses exclusively on active pharmaceutical interventions (excluding devices and procedures), and considers trials in Phase I–IV with valid recruitment statuses.

## 🧠 Objective

To identify and characterise repurposing opportunities by analysing the co-occurrence of drug interventions across multiple disease categories, using centrality and community detection in a drug–disease network constructed from real-world clinical trials.

## 🧪 Methodology Overview

1. **Trial Filtering**  
   - Only **drug-based** interventional trials  
   - Status: `Completed`, `Recruiting`, `Active`  
   - Phases: `I`, `II`, `III`, `IV`

2. **Graph Construction**  
   - **Bipartite Network:** Drugs ↔ Diseases  
   - **Projections:**  
     - Drug–Drug: shared disease connections  
     - Disease–Disease: shared drugs

3. **Centrality Analysis**  
   - **Degree Centrality** – Exposure across diseases  
   - **Betweenness Centrality** – Bridge between disease clusters  
   - **Eigenvector Centrality** – Influence in core clusters

4. **Visualisation**  
   - Top drug hubs coloured and labelled  
   - Network edge labels denote shared entity counts  
   - Disease networks filtered by shared drug threshold

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Dexamethasone**, **Rituximab**, and **Prednisone** rank highly across all centrality metrics, suggesting strong repurposing potential.
- Disease clusters linked by common drugs reveal biological and therapeutic overlaps, e.g., inflammation, oncology, and autoimmunity.
